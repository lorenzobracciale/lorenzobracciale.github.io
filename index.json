These iguanas are endemic to Wolf Volcano, on Isabela Island (Galápagos), where they persist as a single, very small population on the northwestern slope of the volcano. In an attempt to unveil important information about their ecology and behavior we monitored and analyzed the movement data of a male C. marthae collected over a period of 159 days, from 25 September 2019 until 3 March 2020. We used a custom designed GPS-Wireless Sensor Node (WSN) to remotely track and describe the migration pattern of this individual. Using GPS location data and trajectory reconstruction we documented an altitudinal shift of more than 1000 m. These results not only agree with observations recorded while collecting data in the field but were also used to reconstruct and describe the individual's migratory behavior, and to document the potential path that this individual, and presumably others of this species, follow while searching for food or mates. The altitudinal shift described whether shared across individuals of the species or part of intraspecific variation, may be related to different factors. Here, we discuss alternative interpretations of this behavior. The urgent need to gather data on the species’ ecology and develop an appropriate conservation strategy underlines the importance of this research. Although it is not possible to draw conclusions for an entire species based on results from one individual, this work represents a significant advancement for the conservation of this species, as it validates the importance of using cutting-edge remote-tracking technology to collect data on a very elusive species, and it reveals ecological traits not previously documented for these critically endangered iguanas. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH","tags":["behavioral ecology;  conservation management;  endangered species;  habitat use;  lizard;  technology adoption;  tracking","Ecuador;  Galapagos Islands;  Isabela [Galapagos Islands];  Wolf Volcano"],"title":"Remote tracking of Galápagos pink land iguana reveals large elevational shifts in habitat use","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1637659800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637659800,"objectID":"47ac28c22135c52e8223c74c97ff249d","permalink":"https://lorenzobracciale.github.io/talk/how-digital-green-certificate-aka-green-pass-works/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/how-digital-green-certificate-aka-green-pass-works/","section":"event","summary":"Cooperation is a fundamental piece to protect healthcare infrastructures from the increasing number of threats","tags":[],"title":"How Digital Green Certificate (aka Green Pass) works","type":"event"},{"authors":["E.

One response to this is to make initial screening of submissions less time intensive. Reducing screening and review time would save millions of working hours and potentially boost academic productivity. Many platforms have already started to use automated screening tools, to prevent plagiarism and failure to respect format requirements. Some tools even attempt to flag the quality of a study or summarise its content, to reduce reviewers’ load. The recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) create the potential for (semi) automated peer review systems, where potentially low-quality or controversial studies could be flagged, and reviewer-document matching could be performed in an automated manner. However, there are ethical concerns, which arise from such approaches, particularly associated with bias and the extent to which AI systems may replicate bias. Our main goal in this study is to discuss the potential, pitfalls, and uncertainties of the use of AI to approximate or assist human decisions in the quality assurance and peer-review process associated with research outputs. We design an AI tool and train it with 3300 papers from three conferences, together with their reviews evaluations. We then test the ability of the AI in predicting the review score of a new, unobserved manuscript, only using its textual content. We show that such techniques can reveal correlations between the decision process and other quality proxy measures, uncovering potential biases of the review process. Finally, we discuss the opportunities, but also the potential unintended consequences of these techniques in terms of algorithmic bias and ethical concerns. © 2021, The Author(s).","tags":[],"title":"AI-assisted peer review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

HIKE integrates the conventional Linux kernel packet forwarding with custom designed eBPF/XDP (extended Berkeley Packet Filter/eXtreme Data Path) bypass to speed up performance of SRv6 software routers. Thus, in addition to the hybrid IP/SDN forwarding, we foster an additional hybrid approach inside a Linux forwarding engine combining eBPF/XDP and kernel based forwarding, taking the best from both worlds. Therefore, considering the two different conceptual levels of hybridization, we call our overall solution Hybrid squared or Ĥ2. We have applied the Ĥ2 solution to Performance Monitoring (PM) in Hybrid SDNs, and we show how our HIKE data plane architecture supports SRv6 networking and Performance Monitoring (in particular Loss Monitoring) allowing a significant increase in performance: our implementation results show a remarkable throughput improvement (5x) with respect to a conventional Linux based solution. © 2020","tags":["Internet protocols;  Routers","Berkeley packet filters;  Conceptual levels;  Control planes;  Hybrid approach;  Packet forwarding;  Performance monitoring;  Software routers;  Throughput improvement","Linux"],"title":"Performance Monitoring with Ĥ2: Hybrid Kernel/eBPF data plane for SRv6 based Hybrid SDN","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

The research, standardization and implementation of this architecture are actively progressing and SRv6 is already adopted in a number of large scale deployments. Effective solutions for Performance Monitoring (PM) of SRv6 networks are strongly needed and there is a lot of activity in this area. A full blown Performance Monitoring solution needs to include: i) Data Plane (as needed to measure metrics such as packet loss and delay); ii) Control Plane (to send commands to the monitoring entities in the nodes); iii) Management Plane (e.g., to collect the measured metrics). Moreover, Big-Data tools and solutions can be applied inside or above the traditional Management Plane boundaries to store and analyze the collected data. In this article we describe SRv6-PM, a solution for Performance Monitoring of SRv6 networks that deals with all the aspects discussed above. SRv6-PM features a cloud-native architecture that supports: i) the ingestion, processing, storage and visualization of PM data using Big-Data tools; ii) the SDN-based control of network routers to drive the performance monitoring operations. In particular, we focus on Loss Monitoring and consider a solution capable of tracking single packet loss events operating in near-real time (e.g., with a time granularity in the order of 10-20 seconds). SRv6-PM is released as open source. We offer a re-usable and extensible platform that can be automatically deployed in different environments, from a single host to multiple servers on private/public clouds and includes a set of Big-Data tools and the SDN control plane.

In this paper, we present TooLate, a cryptosystem that allows an authority to grant access to a user over a set of encrypted files stored on an offline device. The authority has no connection with the device but is able to centrally manage access control to the remote datastore, providing users with decryption keys whose validity is limited in time and only to specific resources. The system uses a lightweight cryptographic technique suitable for non-tamper-proof, low-power devices. An active security module periodically re-encrypts the entire datastore using keys dynamically generated from a hash chain.

We built a custom-made GPS tracking device that allows to remotely and accurately collect animal position, environmental, and ecological data, including animal temperature and UVB radiation. We designed the device to track the critically endangered Galápagos pink land iguana, Conolophus marthae. Here we illustrate some technical solutions adopted to respond to challenges associated with such task and present some preliminary results from controlled trial experiments and field implementation. Results: Our tests show that estimates of temperature and UVB radiation are affected by the design of our device, in particular by its casing. The introduced bias, though, is systematic and can be corrected using linear and quadratic regressions on collected values. Our data show that GPS accuracy loss, although introduced by vegetation and orientation of the devices when attached to the animals, is acceptable, leading to an average error gap of less than 15 m in more than 50% of the cases. Conclusions: We address some technical challenges related to the design, construction, and operation of a custom-made GPS tracking device to collect data on animals in the wild. Systematic bias introduced by the technological implementation of the device exists. Understanding the nature of the bias is crucial to provide correction models. Although designed to track land iguanas, our device could be used in other circumstances and is particularly useful to track organisms inhabiting locations that are difficult to reach or for which classic telemetry approaches are unattainable. © The Author(s) 2020.

The method has become popular due to the fact that it applies a greedy optimization that does not rely on any statistical knowledge of the underlying process. Moreover, the technique includes a parameter V to control the stability vs utility trade-off, offering a theoretical bound on the performance. However, in its basic form, the optimization ensures that queues are only asymptotically stable, and there is no guarantee that queues will stay below a given threshold at all times. This can affect the applicability of this technique to many applications with queues with limited capacity or, equivalently, systems with hard delay constraints. In this letter we analyse the conditions under which it is possible to set a queue maximum capacity constraint, and we provide a technique to set an extra bound on the parameter V to enforce such constraint. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","tags":["Economic and social effects","Asymptotically stable;  Capacity constraints;  Control techniques;  Greedy optimization;  Lyapunov drift plus penalties;  Performance objective;  Statistical knowledge;  Theoretical bounds","Queueing theory"],"title":"Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty Optimization for Queues with Finite Capacity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

Neighbor discovery instead requires nodes to continuously listen to the radio channel to detect potential and unpredictable messages coming from the arrival of new nodes. These two contrasting needs raise a fundamental question: Should a node be active and listen to the channel or sleep and save energy? Hardware manufacturers introduced dedicated low-power circuitry to allow an energy efficient fast duty cycle (Wake-on Radio) or designed to wake up the main processor when special packets are received (Wake-up Radio). In this work, we propose a novel analytic model optimizing the number of discovered peers for a given energy budget. Our theoretical study demonstrates the existence of an optimum duty cycle in a wide range of operating environments. We designed an adaptive algorithm that dynamically tracks the optimum even in non-stationary conditions, only using local device estimations, therefore allowing nodes to optimize their own duty cycle. Nodes globally converge to a system-wide optimum of a minimal network discovery energy cost. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","tags":["Adaptive algorithms;  Budget control;  Constrained optimization;  Energy efficiency;  Energy utilization;  Internet of things;  Sleep research;  Wakes","Energy-constrained;  Hardware manufacturers;  Low energy consumption;  Neighbor discovery;  Non-stationary condition;  Operating environment;  Opportunistic networks;  Theoretical study","Low power electronics"],"title":"Optimized Neighbor Discovery for Opportunistic Networks of Energy Constrained IoT Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

Indeed, while some content is not frequently updated (e.g., videos), in other cases revisions periodically invalidate contents. In this work, we present an analysis ofWikipedia, currently the 5th most visited website in the world, evaluating the statistics of updates of its pages and their relationship with page view statistics. We discovered that the number of updates of a page follows a lognormal distribution. We provide fitting parameters as well as a goodness of fit analysis, showing the statistical significance of the model to describe the empirical data. We perform an analysis of the views-updates relationship, showing that in a time period of a month, there is a lack of evident correlation between the most updated pages and the most viewed pages. However, observing specific pages, we show that there is a strong correlation between the peaks of views and updates, and we find that in more than 50% of cases, the time difference between the two peaks is less than a week. This reflects the underlying process whereby an event causes both an update and a visit peak that occurs with different time delays. This behavior can pave the way for predictive traffic analysis applications based on content update statistics. Finally, we show how the model can be used to evaluate the performance of an in-network caching scenario. © 2019 by the authors.","tags":["Search engines;  Web crawler","Caching;  Content revisions;  Data statistics;  Popularity;  Wikipedia","Statistics"],"title":"Analysis of data persistence in collaborative content creation systems: The Wikipedia Case","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

Thus, it is a viable solution for supporting Internet of Things (IoT) services without requiring any centralized entity. In this paper, we introduce the lightweight named object solution: a convenient way to represent physical IoT objects in a derived name space, exploiting ICN. We show that this abstraction can: 1) increase the programming simplicity; 2) offer extended functionality, such as augmentation and upgrading, to cope with the 'software erosion,' and 3) implement a common interaction logic involving mutual function invocation.

However, for energy harvesting devices, this can be in sharp contrast with the unreliable and time-varying amount of energy gathered opportunistically from the environment, and the severe energy storage limitations in constrained devices further exacerbate such issue. This article proposes an approach devised to jointly optimize frequency and stability of the sampling rate in energy harvesting sensors. Unlike heuristic approaches, StableSENS builds upon a solid theoretical foundation, namely, Lyapunov optimization, which - to the best of our knowledge - is applied here for the first time to the sensing scenario. One of StableSENS' main assets is its very broad applicability: we remark that neither assumptions nor predictions on future energy availability patterns are required.

The ICN community is working to overcome this issue, designing new software and hardware routers, for setting higher the throughput bar. In this work, we propose to distribute the workload of a router over several physical machines, resulting in a faster, Cluster-based, Scalable ICN router (CSR), able to operate with any current software/hardware ICN solution. We also present the specific challenges that the ICN paradigm poses to the design of a cluster router, and show how our proposed CSR deals with them. The overall forwarding rate can be increased or decreased by suitably dimensioning the number of cluster resources (horizontal scaling) or the performance of individual cluster resources (vertical scaling). When deployed in a cloud environment, the amount of cluster resources can follow the traffic demand, so implementing an elastic ICN router. To assess the feasibility of our approach, we developed a real CSR, based on a new kernel-based ICN load-balancer.

When we do not initially know anything (besides common a priori statistics) about the workers and the questions involved, such problem becomes quite challenging and requires to jointly learn workers’ abilities and questions’ difficulties, while adaptively assigning questions to the most appropriate workers so as to maximize our chances to find which are the correct answers.

It is very easy to implement and offers good performance, especially when data requests are temporally correlated, as in the case of web traffic. When the data content can change during time, as in the case of dynamic websites or within databases, there is the need to prevent the cache to serve stale data. This is usually done by triggering an invalidation event in the cache, to purge all the previously cached data concerning the invalidated data item. The invalidation process tends to worsen the caching performance, since stored items can be invalidated after a short time, thus wasting storage space. Several models in the literature allow quantifying the cache hit probability of an LRU cache, but, to the best of our knowledge, the presence of invalidation events has not been taken into account so far. In this paper, we present an analytical performance evaluation of LRU caches that takes into account data requests and invalidation events, both modeled as independent renewal processes. Simulation results show the accuracy of our model. Moreover, we apply our model to evaluate the LRU performance in the case of a real application, Wikipedia. Finally, we evaluate by means of simulations the effect of invalidation in hierarchical caching. Our work allows us to conclude that the presence of invalidation events does not severely impact the LRU performance in single caches. As a matter of fact, invalidation effects can be ignored there, unless the invalidation rate is comparable with the request rate and the per-object invalidation rate and request rate are highly correlated. However, in the case of hierarchical caching, even a limited effect of invalidation on first-level caches is sufficient to noticeably affect the performance of second level/downstream caches. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","tags":["Internet","Analytical performance evaluations;  Caching;  Caching performance;  Invalidation;  Least recently used;  Real applications;  Replacement policy;  Wikipedia","Digital storage"],"title":"Modeling LRU cache with invalidation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

A new generation of devices complements the acoustic modem with an optical modem that can provide a communication channel with higher capacity and lower power consumption with respect to the acoustic channel. However, the optical link that uses the visible light is very sensitive to the water turbidity that can strongly limit the link coverage. In this paper, we evaluate the networking performances of the Venus vessel, a real AUV prototype equipped with an acoustical modem and an optical modem. The presented analysis aims to evaluate key system parameters allowing to select the best way to set up network communications according to the surrounding conditions (e.g., quality of water) and to the application requirements.

A communication system tailored to provide a reliable and real time updated map of positions and health conditions of floating people can improve efficiency of rescue operation. The aim of the SMARTSOS system is to introduce the capability for each person, equipped with GPS receiver and health sensors, to send information at low cost to a remote location, maximizing delivery probability and quality of service, ensuring also data integrity. Each life vest will be equipped with a terminal able to exchange data only with other life vest terminals; a subset of all life vests (masters) will be equipped also with very small Low Earth Orbit (LEO) 01 GEO satellite terminal to provide long range connectivity; the space segment and the remote service center will complete the architecture. To maximize message delivery probability and to limit power we propose a joint exploitation of linear Network Coding and a store-And-forward mechanism. Each node overhears broadcast communications of neighbors, gathers messages and code them with its own message to re- broadcast the result with an uucoded copy of its message. On the other side, the rescue team will get the position grid and health information of shipwrecked people, planning operations accordingly.

Due to its significant impact on the energy budget of battery equipped devices, energy preserving solutions have been investigated for a long time, often introducing duty cycling. Ultimately, these solutions settle for trade-offs between energy and performance, leaving the final decision on how much energy to allocate to neighbor discovery in the hands of application developers or system engineers. In other words, someone must decide if an improvement in the quality of the discovery (e.g. better discovery latency) is worth an increase in energy consumption. In this paper, we devise a different approach in order to answer the following basic question: how many contacts can a smartphone discover using its battery energy budget? The answer clearly depends on the adopted discovery algorithm, on the mobility conditions, and on the stochastic characteristics of the encounters. However, we demonstrate that there is a natural optimum duty cycle that maximizes the number of discovered contacts in almost every real application scenario. This optimum is natural in the sense that it does not depend on any system level parameter or performance requirements. It depends uniquely on the stochastic characteristics of the meeting process between the nodes. We present an analytic analysis and devise a practical algorithm that dynamically adapts the duty cycle length to the time-varying context, without the need to make assumptions on (or predict) the distribution of the contact duration.

There are cases in which we are interested in simulating just the first interaction between a pair of nodes, for instance to assess the performance of a discovery or epidemic routing protocol. In this cases nodes rapidly extinguish their utility hence it is not convenient to simulate these scenarios using a fixed amount of nodes. Thus we present a novel simulation methodology that introduces the 'open environment' where nodes enter, can interact through meeting with other nodes and then exit, keeping the focus on the environment rather than on what happen before and after the nodes stay in the interesting area. The proposed approach uses the statistical distribution extracted from the real traces to reproduce directly the human interaction pattern without going through the traditional random way point approach. Meetings are simulated by a time-varying graph that holds the state of the interactions in the environment, while adapting to the statistics of single node to its history. We show that even in a simple scenario, the epidemic infection, Markov memory-less models have been fairly far from the interaction scenarios that the method reproduces. © 2014 IEEE.","tags":["Ad hoc networks;  Epidemiology","environment;  Epidemic routing;  Mobility model;  Opportunistic networks;  simulation","Delay tolerant networks"],"title":"Simulating the statistics of the first meetings using dynamic 'open environments'","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

Their performance/memory efficiency makes them appealing in a huge variety of scenarios. Their probabilistic operation, along with the implicit data representation, yields some ambiguity on the actual data stored, which, in scenarios where cryptographic protection is unviable or unpractical, may be somewhat considered as a better than nothing privacy asset. Oddly enough, even if frequently mentioned, to the best of our knowledge the (soft) privacy properties of Bloom filters have never been explicitly quantified. This work aims to fill this gap. Starting from the adaptation of probabilistic anonymity metrics to the Bloom filter setting, we derive exact and (tightly) approximate formulae which permit to readily relate privacy properties with filter (and universe set) parameters. Using such relations, we quantitatively investigate the emerging privacy/utility trade-offs. We finally preliminary assess the advantages that a tailored insertion of a few extra (covert) bits achieves over the commonly employed strategy of increasing ambiguity via addition of random bits. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","tags":["Data structures;  Economic and social effects","Approximate formulas;  Bloom filters;  Data representations;  Probabilistic anonymity;  Probabilistic data;  Random bits;  Set membership;  Trade off","Data privacy"],"title":"Better than nothing privacy with bloom filters: To what extent?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

On the other hand, publish-subscribe is also well suited to satisfy the requirements of a community of users such as the one of an university campus, accompanying other services such as voice and Internet access. The aim of this paper is to present a topic-based, publish-subscribe architecture for intermittently connected networks exploiting IEEE 802.15.4 devices, and taking into due account the severe constraints deriving from their physical characteristics. We describe the architectural model, the protocol design, the system analysis, and the implementation of our solution in a real test-bed, which we carried out in cooperation with Telecom Italia, that financed this work. We point out that our system can be easily adapted to operate in a fully distributed, infrastructure-less way, allowing free communications e.g. in disaster areas or in areas in which usual communications means are either non existent or intentionally made unavailable. For instance, we could realize a server-less version of Twitter able to epidemically distribute information very quickly, provided that we have a high-enough density of devices implementing our solution. © 2011 IIMC.","tags":["Delay Tolerant Networks;  IEEE 802.15.4;  Publish/subscribe;  Spray and Wait;  Topic Based","Access control;  Communication;  Electronic data interchange;  Internet protocols;  Network architecture;  Publishing;  Radio communication;  Radio links;  Shopping centers;  Standards;  Systems analysis;  Wireless networks","Cellular telephone systems"],"title":"A topic-based, publish-subscribe architecture for intermittently connected 802.15.4 networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

For instance, the ZigBee protocol stack, which is one of the most widespread protocol stack for IEEE 802.15.4 low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs), in its current version integrates a network layer not compatible with the IP network layer. Thus in this paper, we first of all describe real application scenarios and mobile services which demonstrate how mobile phones and terminals integrating some kind of wireless proximity technology can take great advantage from the direct interoperability with IP networks.

However, we can envisage also open and interconnected application scenarios, such as the Internet of Things or the integration of ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 nodes in mobile/smart phones, that would greatly benefit from the IP support. The LoWPAN adaptation layer proposed by the 6LoWPAN IETF working group to enable the transmission/reception of IPv6 data in IEEE 802.15.4 networks may be regarded as the first step towards the direction of IP direct support into IEEE 802.15.4 nodes. However, a fully fledged solution to be used in the scenarios outlined above still lacks the following functionality: i) self-configuring address assignment mechanism; ii) multi-hop routing protocol; iii) support of Internet-compliant transport protocols; iv) self-configuring network and service discovery. It may seem trivial to provide such functionality in an IP world, as off the shelf solutions could be adopted; however, this is not an easy task, given the very limited hardware capabilities of IEEE 802.15.4 devices. In this paper we define a complete protocol architecture and specific self-configuring mechanisms to support the aforementioned functionality over IEEE 802.15.4 devices, taking into account their hardware constraints.

RRA ensures persistent data availability by duplicating data over replicanodes, while minimizing the consumption of radio resources. RRA is the first algorithm thoroughly designed to operate in environments with node failures and radio obstacles (e.g., buildings, walls). Our challenge is to consider such impairments as \\\"accidental\\\"; i.e., their occurrence neither can be run-time predicted, nor can be a-priori quantified in terms of probability. As instance, this is the case of nodes wandering in an unknown territory. To cope efficiently with the novel challenge, we suggest a practical assumption: during a refresh period, only a single accidental impairment may occur. Following this assumption, we succeed in formalizing (and solving) the resource minimization problem as the finding of a minimum-cost-set-cover. We assess RRA performance through NS2 simulations.

In such systems, the stream is divided in chunks; chunks are delivered by each node in a store-and-forward way. A relaying node starts distributing a chunk only when it has completed its reception from another node. Peers are logically organized in a forest of trees, where each tree includes all peers. The source periodically distributes different chunks to each tree for their delivery. Our key idea consists in employing serial transmission: for each tree, and thus, for each chunk, the source node sends the chunk to its children in series; the same holds for each peer node of the tree, excluding the leaves. Besides this basic idea, the contributions of this paper are: 1) we demonstrate the feasibility of serial transmission over a forest of trees, which is not a trivial problem, unlike the case of parallel transmission; 2) we derive an analytical model to evaluate the system performance; 3) we derive a theoretical bound for the number of nodes reachable in a given time interval or equivalently for the time required to reach a given number of nodes; 4) we prove the optimality of our approach in terms of its capability to reach such bound; and 5) we develop a general simulation package for P2P streaming systems and use it to compare our solution to literature results. Finally, we stress that this paper is focused on the theoretical properties and performance understanding of the proposed distribution algorithm, rather than on its practical implementation in a real system. However, we also briefly describe a practical workable implementation of our algorithm. © 2006 IEEE.","tags":["Analytical model;  Basic idea;  Distributed applications;  Distributed systems;  Distribution algorithms;  Optimal distributions;  Optimality;  P2P streaming;  Parallel transmission;  Peer nodes;  Peer to peer;  Performance attributes;  Performance of systems;  Practical implementation;  Real systems;  Real time streaming;  Relaying Nodes;  Serial transmission;  Simulation packages;  Source nodes;  Store and forward;  Theoretical bounds;  Time interval","Algorithms;  Computer simulation;  Mathematical models","Peer to peer networks"],"title":"Streamline: An optimal distribution algorithm for peer-to-peer real-time streaming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

As shown in this paper, when posed for chunk-based systems, and as a consequence of the store-and-forward way in which chunks are delivered across the network, this question has a fundamentally different answer with respect to the case of systems where the streamed content is distributed through one or more flows (sub-streams). To circumvent the complexity emerging when directly dealing with delay, we express performance in term of a convenient metric, called \\\"stream diffusion metric\\\".We show that it is directly related to the end-to-end minimum delay achievable in a P2P streaming network. In a homogeneous scenario, we derive a performance bound for such metric, and we show how this bound relates to two fundamental parameters: the upload bandwidth available at each node, and the number of neighbors a node may deliver chunks to. In this bound, k-step Fibonacci sequences do emerge, and appear to set the fundamental laws that characterize the optimal operation of chunk-based systems.","tags":["Delay bound;  Delay performance;  Fibonacci sequences;  Fundamental laws;  Fundamental parameters;  Minimum delay;  Optimal operation;  P2P streaming;  Peer to peer;  Peer-to-peer streaming;  Performance bounds;  Real time streaming;  Store and forward;  Sub-streams","Real time systems"],"title":"Fundamental delay bounds in peer-to-peer chunk-based real-time streaming systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.L.

Literature papers typically design chunk scheduling algorithms by considering the chunk delivery ratio as performance metric. We propose a push-based algorithm, which not only tries to maximize the chunk delivery ratio but it also takes into account and tries to minimize the delivery delay of chunks at the peer nodes. This is an important requirement, when dealing with real-time multimedia flows. Another important contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of a simulator able to evaluate the performance of large scale P2P networks (tens of thousands peers). The importance of this contribution lies in the fact that existing simulators and performance studies handle at most hundreds or few thousands of peers, while real-life P2P streaming systems aim at distributing contents to several hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of users. The performance evaluation study aims at providing a comprehensive view of what performance can be expected for mesh-based peer-to-peer streaming systems, both in terms of chunk delivery ratio and delay, for a large range of the number of users. The individual effect of a variety of system parameters, and especially number of partner nodes in the mesh, constrained link bandwidth, node heterogeneity, and network size, has been analyzed. Our results show that performances of the proposed push-based solution are already quite effective even with severely bandwidth constrained large scale networks. © 2008 IEEE.","tags":["Distributed computer systems;  Internet protocols;  Scheduling;  Simulators;  Telecommunication systems;  Video streaming","Bandwidth constrained;  Delivery delays;  Delivery ratio;  IP-networks;  Large range;  Large-scale networks;  Link bandwidths;  Live streaming;  Multi services;  Network sizes;  P2p networks;  P2P streaming;  Peer nodes;  Peer-to-Peer;  Peer-to-peer streaming;  Performance evaluation;  Performance metric;  Real-time multimedia;  System parameters","Scheduling algorithms"],"title":"A push-based scheduling algorithm for large scale P2P live streaming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

However, due to the lack of basic theoretical results and bounds, common sense and intuitions and heuristics have driven their design so far. The consequence is that we can find in the literature a large variety of different choices about the main aspects of a P2P system, such as overlay topology, scheduling process and upload strategy. In this situation, it is difficult to establish unambiguously the absolute goodness of a particular algorithm or even the rationale behind a particular choice or solution. In this paper we propose and evaluate a theory-driven distribution algorithm for P2P real time streaming. We take advantage from a previous theoretical study, where: i) we derived a theoretical performance bound for forest-based overlay topologies regarding the number of nodes reachable in a given time interval or equivalently the time required to reach a given number of nodes; ii) we proved the optimality of Streamline, a distribution algorithm based on the serial transmission over forest-based topologies, in terms of its capability to reach such a bound. The Streamline algorithm is based on some ideal assumptions that prevent its practical implementation. In this paper we remove these assumptions and present a practical and working algorithm, named Operational Streamline or simply O-Streamline. We also evaluate the performance of O-Streamline, comparing them with the optimal bounds of Streamline. © 2008 IEEE.","tags":["Common sense;  Distribution algorithms;  Optimal bounds;  Optimality;  Overlay topologies;  P2P system;  Peer to peer;  Practical implementation;  Real time streaming;  Scheduling process;  Serial transmission;  Theoretical performance;  Theoretical result;  Theoretical study;  Time interval","Distributed computer systems;  Evolutionary algorithms;  Real time systems","Topology"],"title":"A theory-driven distribution algorithm for peer-to-peer real time streaming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.
