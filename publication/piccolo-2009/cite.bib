 abstract = {This extended abstract describes a poster and a proposal for demonstration. Its focus is on low rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) which use IEEE 802.15.4 physical and MAC layers at the lower layers of the protocol stack. More precisely, goal of this extended abstract is to present a real test-bed, whose main goal is to demonstrate how IEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPANs can fully inter-operate with IP networks. To this end, the protocol stack implemented at each IEEE 802.15.4 node includes the so said LoWPAN adaptation layer, which has been defined by the IETF 6LoWPAN working group. Moreover, we will present a possible practical solution for the problem of how to realize a gateway between the IEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPANs and the IP networks1. Â© 2009 IEEE.},
