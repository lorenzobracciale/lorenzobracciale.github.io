 abstract = {In this work we assess the delay performance of a Publish Subscribe system built on top of a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) composed of nodes with limited storage capacities. Many DTN routing protocols replicate the same data over several nodes, in order to deliver data to destination in a faster or in a more reliable way. Of course, increasing the number of replicas has the effect of decreasing the delivery delay perceived by the users, but increases the use of the system memory. © 2011 IEEE.},
