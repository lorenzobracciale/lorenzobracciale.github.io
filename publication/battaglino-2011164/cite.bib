 abstract = {The aim of this extended abstract is to present Campus++, a location-based publish-subscribe system for intermittently connected delay tolerant networks, exploiting IEEE 802.15.4 devices, and taking into due account the severe constraints deriving from their physical characteristics. We describe our proposed architectural model and how we implemented our solution in a real test-bed. We point out that our system can be easily adapted to operate in a fully distributed, infrastructure-less way, allowing free communications e.g. in disaster areas or in areas in which "usual" communications means are either non existent or intentionally made unavailable. © 2011 IEEE.},
